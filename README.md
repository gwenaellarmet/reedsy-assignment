## Discover Section Challenge

Create a SPA, that displays the books available in the `books.json` file in this Gist.
An example wireframe is also attached to this Gist, but please feel free to deviate and be as creative as you like.

### Requirements

This is a small 2 page SPA, consisting of an index page (list of books) and a show page (detailed view of each book).

* The books index page should be:

    - Filterable (by category and genre) - DONE
    - Searchable (by title and author) - DONE
    - Pageable (either frontend or backend pagination is fine for this) - TODO

* The books index page should show the following data for each book:

    - Cover image - DONE
    - Title - DONE
    - Author - DONE
    - Votes - DONE
    - Published date (bonus points for relative time) - DONE

* When a book is clicked it then displays the books show page. - DONE

* The books show page should display the same data visible from the index page with the addition of:

    - Author avatar - TODO
    - Introductory contents - TODO
    - 3 recommended books (from a similar genre and category) - TODO

* Your implementation should be provided as a public Github repository, with instructions on how to run the code locally.

### What we'll be looking at

* The structure, modularity and overall quality of any code and markup.
* The suitability of the chosen technologies
* Documentation
* Creativity
