## Discover Section Challenge

Create a SPA, that displays the books available in the `books.json` file in this Gist.
An example wireframe is also attached to this Gist, but please feel free to deviate and be as creative as you like.

### Requirements

This is a small 2 page SPA, consisting of an index page (list of books) and a show page (detailed view of each book).

* The books index page should be:

    - Pageable (either frontend or backend pagination is fine for this) - TODO

* The books show page should display the same data visible from the index page with the addition of:

    - 3 recommended books (from a similar genre and category) - TODO
    - Link to index books with filters - TODO 

* Your implementation should be provided as a public Github repository, with instructions on how to run the code locally.

### What we'll be looking at

* The structure, modularity and overall quality of any code and markup.
* The suitability of the chosen technologies
* Documentation
* Creativity
